# Graph Database Enhancements Roadmap

## Current State
- ✅ Basic graph structure with transactions as nodes
- ✅ Three types of edges: similarity, temporal, merchant
- ✅ Graph Neural Network (GNN) implementation
- ✅ Fixed numpy float64 type conversion issues
- ✅ Mobile-friendly Streamlit interface

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Graph Analytics
- [ ] **Community Detection**: Find clusters of related transactions
- [ ] **Centrality Measures**: Identify most important transactions/merchants
- [ ] **Path Analysis**: Find transaction patterns and flows
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection via Graph**: Use graph structure for better anomaly detection

### 2. Enhanced Graph Visualization
- [ ] **Interactive 3D Graph**: Implement interactive 3D visualization
- [ ] **Graph Filtering**: Filter by time periods, amounts, merchants
- [ ] **Subgraph Extraction**: Extract and visualize specific subgraphs
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Live graph updates as new transactions come in

### 3. Advanced Machine Learning on Graphs
- [ ] **Graph Embeddings**: Learn better node representations
- [ ] **Link Prediction**: Predict future transaction relationships
- [ ] **Graph Classification**: Classify transaction patterns
- [ ] **Time Series on Graphs**: Temporal graph neural networks

### 4. Smart Query Enhancements
- [ ] **Graph-based Search**: "Find all transactions related to X"
- [ ] **Pattern Matching**: "Find patterns similar to this sequence"
- [ ] **Influence Analysis**: "What transactions influenced this one?"
- [ ] **Recommendation Engine**: "Suggest similar transactions to review"

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Graph Caching**: Cache frequently accessed graph structures
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch updates for large datasets
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage for large graphs
- [ ] **Distributed Computing**: Scale to handle massive transaction datasets

### 6. Advanced Features
